# TSFApp

This is the app that I was supposed to develop for my internship, If you find any errors you're free to cretea a pull request,
If by any chance you want to work with me on it create a seperate branch and go ahead.


The rest(ful) API I used were taken from somewhere (all credit goes to the creater).
